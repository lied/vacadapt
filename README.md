# vacadapt
VaCADapt


# Usage
- install Autodesk Fusion 360
- install [parametric text plugin](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=2114937992453312456&os=Win64&appLang=en) for Fusion 360
- download the latest Fusion project file: VaCADapt vXX.f3d
- open the parameter config of fusion and put in the variables you need for your Hose or machine

# idea
Every part of the adapter is designed one time as dedicated component in fusion. The different adapters (machine to hose, hose to female, hose to male) are then sticked together from the base components.
This way it's possible to have it all together in one single Fusion 360 project.

# why another OSVac clone?
OSVac is dedicated to 32mm hoses, where in my shop I have multiple hoses with different sizes. I could have been using NeoVAC, which elimates this problem, but it has the downside of having multiple projects in Fusion open at the same time - which with my free license is a bottleneck. Additionally this project has a bajonett close function, which comes handy once printing adapters with diameters > 80mm

# how to contribute?
Contribution, ideas, constructive criticism are highly welcome. If possible I would love to have a pull request with your additions to the project or send me the project file some other way, and I try to merge it then.
